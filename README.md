## Installation

In so far as this being a web app, no traditional installation is necessary.

## Usage

When you go to the app site you will be immediately redirected to the signup page with a login option, once an account is made or the user logs in, they will have an option make a team or join one from a list of existing teams with open slots. Secondarily if you are on a team with open slots you can recruit other players to your team.

## Roadmap

In the future we plan to roll out proper matchmaking functionality, linkage to specific game APIs to allow for accurate/verified player info, as well as connection to third-party communication software for improved matchmaking organization.
